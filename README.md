# Speech & Music classification

Dataset: [GTZAN Music Speech Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gtzan_music_speech)

The main goal of the presented project is to build a simple CNN model for the purpose of binary classification with the use of TensorFlow framework. Rigorous experimentation encompasses varying layers, parameters, and techniques like callbacks, dropout, and max-pooling, all aimed at refining model performance.

The project also involves building a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) models to generate additional spectrograms, augmenting the dataset.  Subsequently, a classification model is trained on this augmented data, exploring the synergy between CNNs and GANs in audio classification.
